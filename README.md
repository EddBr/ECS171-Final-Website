# ECS171-Final-Website

CURRENTLY NOT LIVE [HERE](https://ecs-171-final-website.vercel.app/ "Our site!")

Unfortunately, Vercel does not allow the installation of scikit-learn, as the full package size is too large. Therefore, it must be run locally


## To Run
run using `flask --app app run`

## Requirements
`pip install Flask`
`pip install Flask-WTF`
`pip install scikit-learn`
